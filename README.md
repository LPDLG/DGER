# DGER

## Project Profile

This repository is used for demonstrations and testing based on the DGER framework. We have uploaded 10 sample video along with their corresponding text descriptions.

## Method Overview

This paper proposes the Dynamic Golden Monkey Emotion Recognition framework (DGER), which for the first time realizes end-to-end collaborative modeling of cross-species facial micro-expressions, providing a new technological paradigm for the conservation of endangered primates. 
By integrating multimodal data and innovative attention mechanisms, a dual-stream perception mechanism is designed to enhance the model's ability to capture specific micro-movements of golden monkeys, such as eyebrow arch trembling and ear retraction. The framework also combines spatiotemporal collaborative attention to improve the model's ability to model inter-frame correlations. 
Additionally, an ecological semantic coupler is introduced to adaptively adjust text weights, effectively resolving ambiguities in behavioral semantics such as "baring teeth â†’ threat/playfulness." Based on the self-built dynamic emotion dataset of golden monkeys, Emokey, DGER achieves state-of-the-art performance with a UAR of 75.04% and a WAR of 76.14%. 
This framework not only provides a quantitative tool for decoding the social behaviors of golden monkeys but also offers new insights into the human-machine collaborative interpretation of natural emotions.

## Code

We will upload the training scripts, testing code, and the complete dataset in future updates.
